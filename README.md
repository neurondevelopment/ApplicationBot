<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The application bot is a highly customisable bot, with easy to use applications, using Discord's dropdowns, buttons and slash commands to create an easy to use, interactive experience for the user. With automatic inviting, role granting, logging, and restriction to specific roles, this bot should be perfect for all users looking to recruit new people.

Some of the features:
* Easily accept / deny application through discord buttons
* Create one-time invites on acceptance to invite a user to a discord server
* Individually open / close applications
* Easy to customise & setup
* Creates dedicated channel per application, giving perms to those you specify
* Customisable accept / deny messages
* Lots of logging
* Easily restrict commands
